            By looking at the development and knowledge of children
            today about science, invention and innovation, especially in
            the field of science, it requires us to know the extent of the
            student’s insights, knowledge and abilities in applying their
            knowledge of science.
            Therefore, our Indonesian Young Scientist Association (IYSA)
            Indonesia will hold an international-level Invention
            competition called “International Science and Invention Fair
            (ISIF)" as the right learning platform to nurture our young
            talented inventors who are active, creative and innovative.
            Indonesian Young Scientist Association (IYSA) is an
            institution that moves on the development of the potential,
            talents and creativity of the Indonesian students on
            competition and non-scientific competition domestically or
            abroad. Therefore, IYSA stands as a form of our deep concern
            provide opportunities for Indonesian students specifically, in
            order to bring up potential and the skills needed and
            soul-building competition in themselves. We do this to create
            improvements in life. Because, we believe that every student
            has potential which can be developed.
